## Learning
### If Else Condition Operation
- Equals: a == b
- Not Equals: a != b
- Less than: a < b
- Less than or equal to: a <= b
- Greater than: a > b
- Greater than or equal to: a >= b

### If Else Condition Example
- elif : if the previous conditions were not true, then try the current condition
- else : The else keyword catches anything which isn't caught by the preceding conditions.
```
a = 200
b = 33
if b > a:
  print("b is greater than a")
elif a == b:
  print("a and b are equal")
else:
  print("a is greater than b")
```
