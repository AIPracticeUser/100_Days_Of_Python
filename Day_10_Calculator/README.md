# Calculator Program

## LESSON: Functions with Output and Docstring

### Functions with output
- The Python return statement is a special statement that you can use inside a function or method to send the functionâ€™s result back to the caller.
- A return statement consists of the return keyword followed by an optional return value.
- You can omit the return value of a function and use a bare return without a return value, the return value will be None.

```
# Example
>>> def get_even(numbers):
...     even_nums = [num for num in numbers if not num % 2]
...     return even_nums
...

>>> get_even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
[2,4,6]
```

The list comprehension gets evaluated and then the function returns with the resulting list. 
 * Note that you can only use expressions in a return statement.
 
```
# Example with list comprehension
>>> def get_even(numbers):
...     return [num for num in numbers if not num % 2]
...

>>> get_even([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
[2, 4, 6]
```

### Returning Multiple Values
- You can use a return statement to return multiple values from a function. 
- To do that, you just need to supply several return values separated by commas.
```
import statistics as st

def describe(sample):
    return st.mean(sample), st.median(sample), st.mode(sample)
```

### Exercise 1: Days in month
- Calculate the number of days depends on the input year and month. If leap year, there's 29 days in Feb.

### DocString
- Python docstrings are strings used right after the definition of a function, method, class, or module (like in Example 1). They are used to document our code.
- Different from comments, comments are descriptions that help programmers better understand the intent and functionality of the program.

- usage of .___doc___ to call out the docstring
```
print(square.__doc__)
```

### Calculator 
- First step (Adding basic calculator functions)
```
def add(n1,n2):
  return n1 + n2

#Subtract
def subtract(n1,n2):
  return n1 - n2

#Multiply
def multiply(n1,n2):
  return n1 * n2

#Divide
def divide(n1,n2):
  return n1 / n2

operations = {
  "+": add,
  "-": subtract,
  "*": multiply,
  "/": divide
}

num1 = int(input("What's the first number?: "))
for symbol in operations:
  print(symbol)
operation_symbol = input("Pick an operation from the line above: ")
num2 = int(input("What's the second number?: "))
calculation_function = operations[operation_symbol]
answer = calculation_function(num1, num2)

print(f"{num1} {operation_symbol} {num2} = {answer}")
```

- Second Step (Adding Recursive Function for further operations)
```
def contiune_operation(first_num):
  """
  input: first_num (int)
  function: Perform calculation based on user's selection
  output: answer (int)
  """
  next_operation = input("Pick an operation: ")
  second_num = int(input("What's the next number?: "))
  calculation_function = operations[next_operation]
  answer = calculation_function(first_num, second_num)
  print(f"{first_num} {next_operation} {second_num} = {answer}")
  return answer
  
```
