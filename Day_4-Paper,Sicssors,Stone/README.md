Rock Paper Scissors
- Mini game of the traditional paper, scissors, stone
- AIM: Understanding randomization and Lists

Instructions
- Make a rock, paper, scissors game.
- Inside the main.py file, you'll find the ASCII art for the hand signals already saved to a corresponding variable: rock, paper, and scissors. This will make it easy to print them out to the console.
- Start the game by asking the player:
- "What do you choose? Type 0 for Rock, 1 for Paper or 2 for Scissors."

- Python Lists 
- Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- List items are ordered, changeable, and allow duplicate values.
- List items are indexed, the first item has index [0], the second item has index [1] etc.
- Example: mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"] 

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
- Combine List and random module.choice()
- The choice() method returns a randomly selected element from the specified sequence.
- Example: mylist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
