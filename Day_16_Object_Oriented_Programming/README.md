# Object Oriented Programming

Solution: https://replit.com/@LightGamer1/oop-coffee-machine-start#main.py
- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.

- For instance, an object could represent a person with attributes like a name, age, and address and methods such as walking, talking, breathing, and running.

- Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.

## Quiz
- Question 1: In OOP what is the name of the blueprint for creating objects?
- a) Attribute
- b) Method
- c) Class
- d) Instance

- Ans: Class

- Question 2: Given a Class blueprint for a Car has the following attributes and methods, which line of code in the answers will produce an error?
- Attributes: num_of_seats, speed
- Methods: drive(), brake
- a) car.drive()
- b) car.num_of_seats = 2
- c) car.brake() = 0
- d) print(car.speed)

- Ans: car.brake() = 0
- Reason: brake is a method, which means it's a function associated with the car object. We cannot assign a value to a function call.

- Question 3:
- my_toyota = Car()
- my_fiat = Car()
- What word would you use to describe what's inside my_toyota and my_fiat?
- a) Class
- b) Attribute
- c) Variable
- d) Object
- e) Method

- Ans: Object
