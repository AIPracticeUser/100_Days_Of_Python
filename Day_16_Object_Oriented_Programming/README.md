# Object Oriented Programming

- Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a method of structuring a program by bundling related properties and behaviors into individual objects.

- For instance, an object could represent a person with attributes like a name, age, and address and methods such as walking, talking, breathing, and running.

- Classes are used to create user-defined data structures. Classes define functions called methods, which identify the behaviors and actions that an object created from the class can perform with its data.
